//This is my ** Domain Specific Mini Project **

This project is the simulation / model of Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV)
This project requires:

Hardware Requirements:
           1) Two DC Motors.
           2) L239D MOTOR DRIVER.
           3) FC-03 INFRARED SPEED SENSOR.
           4) ESP8266 WIFI MODULE.
           5) ARDUINO UNO.
           6) BATTERY.
         
Software Requirements:
           1) ARDUINO.
           2) ANDROID STUDIO (for making mobile application).
           
           
How to install:
          1) First upload the ESP8266_CODE to ESP8266 module using Arduino software through arduino board.
          2) Then upload Arduino_motor code to arduino with the same process.
          3) Set your mobile hotspot name as "kashi" and password as "kashi123456" (Mobile application had internally set to this name and password, if you make your own moblie application then you may change it as your hotspot name).
          4) Install AGV.apk to your device. Register and login to application.
          5) Wait for ESP8266 module to connect your device. Boom, you are set to run now.
