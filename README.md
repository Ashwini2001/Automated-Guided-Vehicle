# Automated-Guided-Vehicle
Automated Guided vehicle is a robot that can deliver the materials from the supply area to the technician automatically.

This is faster and more efficient. The robot can be accessed wirelessly. 

I.e. a technician can directly order the robot to deliver the components rather than order it via a human operator (over phone, computer etc. who has to program the robot or ask a delivery person to make the delivery). 

To avoid collision with human workers, a proximity detector has been added which causes the robot to stop as long as there is an obstacle in its way, thus avoiding accidents.
